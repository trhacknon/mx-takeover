**mx-takeover** focuses DNS MX records and detects misconfigured MX records. It currently support three technique. These are,
- MX domains that will expire soon
- Unregistered MX domains
- Domains that points to not currently in use by mailgun.

 
# How to works
### Attack Scenario for Mailgun  
1. Your company starts using a new service for emails.
2. Your company's mx record points to mailgun. (eg: sub.domain.com MX mxa.mailgun.com)
3. Your company stops using mailgun but does not remove the mx record from DNS
4. Attacker signs up for the mailgun and claims the domain as theirs. No verification is done by the mailgun, and the DNS-setup is already correctly setup.
5. Attacker can now read mail that sent associated the domain. (\<something\>@sub.domain.com)

**Limitation**  
Mailgun uses MX records for mail receiving, TXT records for mail sending and CNAME record for tracking. Of these records only the DKIM record is unique and generated randomly. 

Therefore, can not be sent mails on behalf of someone else, but can be read(receive) mails sent by someone else to associated domain.

**Important Uptade (15.06.2022):** Mailgun now requires DNS verification for all records(MX, TXT, CNAME) even only for mail receiving. Before fix, in order to receive mail was just enought MX verification.  About three week ago, this was working but vulnerability have fixed now by mailgun. It was sending successfully when mail was sent before and you could access mail content from Maigun logs but now you are getting "relaying denied" error. If you try send you will get `Remote Server returned '550 5.7.367 Remote server returned not permitted to relay -> 550 5.7.1 Relaying denied'` error.
